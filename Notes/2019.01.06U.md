# Mahlinger Thank You Note

Dear Mahlingers

Thank you for thinking of us during the holidays. We miss seeing you all.

We really appreciate the "Taste of Owensboro" Bourbon Chocolates. They are delightful, especially on a cold night with a warm fire in the fireplace. Dark chocolate is Dana's favorite. 

How is Taylor doing in collage and how is Mckenzie doing without her sister at home. Is she still a music major? She always seemed to have a real talent for composing and singing.

The boys are staying busy working and going to school. Dana is planning to retire this year. He is really looking forward to it. It will be the next chapter of our lives. 

We hope this letter finds you all doing well. It was a pleasure to hear from you. 

Thanks again for still thinking of us. We still visit Dana's Uncle Bill in Hartford. Maybe we can see you all again some day.
