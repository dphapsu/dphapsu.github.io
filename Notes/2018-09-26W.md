## A Dream Regarding The Nature of the Soul

I was on a train or a trolley with a bunch of what I considered ignorant Christians and i was already quite irritated with them. Their leader rhetorically asked why are groups of people so much more than an individual? Out of irritation I answered him. 

1. Each of us has inside of us a minute piece of God. 
2. We call this a soul. 
3. When a group of people join together with the same goals, the same intent, these pieces synchronize and begin to act in unison. The result is greater than the sum of the parts.
