Anybody there
Sorry about that Mr Wheeler
May I ask the reason you want to return the package?
You (change name)
Hate to say but the quality of the pump is not sufficient. The polystyrene plastic will fatigue and break quickly. Especially the release mechanism.
I'm sorry to hear that.  If you would like you can upgrade to the metal pump for $15. We would send you the metal pump along with a return tag for the plastic pump
Would you be interested in upgrading?

No thanks. I think I will stay with the return.

OK. Thanks.
Your welcome. I'm sorry the system did not work for you

Not a problem. Though I might suggest an upgrade to ABS or some other more durable plastic that can still be injection molded.
Thank you for the suggestion. I will pass that to management

Have a good day. Goodbye.
You too
